# DiscordCodeDetectorBot

Leverages the [guesslang ML model](https://guesslang.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contents.html#how-does-guesslang-guess) to detect what programming language is used in a user's message. 
Can be configured to activate upon reaction to or sending of message. 

The bot must be invited to the Discord Guild and hosted on some server/localhost to provide any functionality
